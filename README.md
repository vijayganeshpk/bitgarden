# Bitgarden: An Enhanced GUI for Bitwarden

## Project Overview

Bitgarden is an open-source project aimed at developing a more user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for Bitwarden, addressing several limitations in the current official GUI.

## Key Features

Bitgarden aims to improve upon the following shortcomings of the current Bitwarden GUI:

1. **Intuitive Folder Management**:

   - Create child folders directly by right-clicking on the parent folder.
   - Move folders easily from one location to another through drag-and-drop functionality.

2. **Enhanced Search Capabilities**:
   - Implement global search functionality.
   - Provide UI options to define the scope of the search (e.g., specific folders, all folders, tags).
